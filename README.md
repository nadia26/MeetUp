An application that will find the midpoint in the route between two addresses and display restaurants, events, and bakeries near that midpoint. Users can select one locale from each of those categories and add them to a "date" object, which is saved to the users account. People can also use the website without creating accounts, to find the most convenient meeting point between one's home and that of a friend. 

## Timeline
### As of May 11 - Have completed initial form, dual display of results, also have finished the nearby places--just need to link it to the form 
### May 17 - Complete a algorithm to find intermediate point in transit route
### May 20 - Display transit directions. Give options for preffered meeting places
### May 23 - Display meeting places, hopefully with Yelp. Tweak, add random location generator?
### June 10 - Created accounts, users can log in/ log out/ save "dates" (restaurant, bakeries, events)
### June 13 - Displaying meetups

##Addtional ideas:
- using the New York Times API, the user will pick a borough and we will display events happening in that borough that they could pick to meet up at with their friends.
