An application that will find the midpoint in the route between two addresses and display restaurants, events, and bakeries near that midpoint. Users can select one locale from each of those categories and add them to a "date" object, which is saved to the users account. People can also use the website without creating accounts, to find the most convenient meeting point between one's home and that of a friend.
