## timeline
### As of May 11 - Have completed initial form, dual display of results
### May 17 - Complete a algorithm to find intermediate point in transit route
  COMPLETED ON MAY 12!
### May 20 - Display transit directions. Give options for preffered meeting places
### May 23 - Display meeting places, hopefully with Yelp
### Tweak, add random location generator?

##Addtional ideas:
- using the New York Times API, the user will pick a borough and we will display events happening in that borough that they could pick to meet up at with their friends.
